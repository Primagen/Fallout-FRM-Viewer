Fallout-FRM-Viewer
==================

A simple, currently incomplete Fallout 1/2 FRM Viewer. Uses SFML.\n<br>
See: http://falloutmods.wikia.com/wiki/FRM_File_Format


Directions:
  After the main window opens and is active, press L, and you will be prompted at the console to type in the name of the .FRM you want to load. Type in the name of the file, not including the art directory or .frm extension. Probably best to alt-tab between the two windows, until I set up a better UI.
  
  All FRM files must be in [directory of executable]/art/ and should not contain spaces.
  color.pal should be in the same directory as the executable.
