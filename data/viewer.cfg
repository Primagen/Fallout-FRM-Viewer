# viewer.cfg
#
# In charge of a bunch of runtime values for the FRM viewer
# This file should be in [executable_path]/data
#
# Hardcoded default values when a value is not set:
#   screen_width  = 800
#   screen_height = 600
#   vsync         = false
#   max_fps       = 100
#   frm_path      = ./art
#
# Notes:
#   There may some input lag if vsync is on,
#     or when max_fps is too low
#     depending on your graphics card?
#   Let me know if it's unbearable and what settings you're using...

# Render Window stuff:

screen_height = 600
vsync   = false    #false unless "true", "on", or "1"
max_fps = 100      #only taken into account if vsync is off

# FRM stuff:

# IMPORTANT: path is current hardcoded to be ./art.
# Changing the follwing frm_path won't do anything
